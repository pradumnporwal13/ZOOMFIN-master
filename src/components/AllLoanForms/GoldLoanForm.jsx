        <p class="text-gray-700 mb-4 text-justify">
          A gold loan is a type of secured loan where you can pledge your gold jewelry or coins as collateral to obtain a loan. Gold loans offer several advantages, such as lower interest rates, quick processing, and minimal paperwork. They are a great option if you need immediate funds and have gold assets to secure the loan.
        </p>
        <p class="text-gray-700 text-justify">
          By opting for a gold loan, you can access funds while keeping your gold assets safe. The loan amount is determined based on the value of the gold pledged, and you can repay the loan over a flexible period. Additionally, gold loans often come with the benefit of no prepayment penalties and competitive interest rates.
